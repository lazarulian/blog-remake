## Introduction

Throughout life, specific experiences often leave long-lasting shifts in perspective
involving what individuals hold essential in their lives. A subset of these experiences, often
inducing feelings that make individuals believe they have a shortened lifespan, has been
correlated with influencing the change in morals, character, and ideals about what is important in
life. These changes in perspective are often similar to the changes that
occur as one ages. The common denominator these two examples share is the perspective of
time, suggesting that it may influence how we live our lives. Accepting and internalizing that life
will end allows for a lifestyle promoting living in the present and seeking enriching positive
experiences.

## Socioemotional Selectivity Theory

To understand why aging might influence our mindfulness in daily life and bias toward
positive experiences, it is vital to understand Socioemotional Selectivity Theory. Proposed by
Laura Carstensen at Stanford University, Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST) suggests that
with age, an individual's social goals shift, prioritizing emotionally meaningful goals over
knowledge-based goals, which often promotes biases for positive life experiences (Carstensen 1).
For instance, rather than taking on an intensive job that might lead to career development at the
sacrifice of work-life balance, someone older might opt to take a more relaxed job and use their
free time with family. In this example, the individual makes an emotionally relevant decision that
can improve their emotional well-being and avoids the potentially harmful experience that an
intense career might bring. These decisions are often a result of the idea that the awareness of our
limited time left influences our social goal in a more meaningful direction.

## Socioemotional Selectivity Theory Among Younger Generations

Although the studies regarding SST are most commonly referencing the changes that
occur with time, we can see these same changes in individuals whose perception of time
changes. For example, in high school, I created a video-interview series called The Hope
Initiative that explored the unexpected levels of optimism in people diagnosed with a terminal
illnesses. One of the people I interviewed, D. Lake, explained that when her lifespan shortened
within a matter of minutes, she realized there was no time for negativity in her life since there
would not be much more of it. This was a common realization among the people I interviewed, regardless of their background and chronological age. These brutal yet beautiful experiences
made me wonder whether people could experience this positive phenomenon without enduring a
traumatic life-changing event.

Explicit reminders of the temporary nature of life can bring some of the positive changes
that come with age to younger individuals. For example, merely interviewing and talking with
the people I met at Relay for Life allowed me to gain a deeper appreciation for some aspects of
life that I generally take for granted, incentivizing me to focus on the positives within my life.
Furthermore, sharing the interviews with peers heightened their awareness of the temporary
nature of life, encouraging them to pursue goals and decisions that were more emotionally
relevant to them.

## Improving Life Satisfaction

The question arises of how we can encapsulate that sensation and allow it to consistently
influence our lives. In general, for people who do not directly experience something that changes
their lifespan, the effects of this understanding are generally temporary. Thus, an important
aspect of introducing this idea is to ensure that we are reminded of this fact repeatedly while still
being able to appreciate its message. Possible approaches to this idea are allowing more
representative older representation within our media rather than focusing on negative
stereotypes, promoting the integration of older folks within society rather than ostracizing them
out into retirement communities and dispelling the negative stigma that shrouds the concept of
death. Accurate older representation might dispel more wisdom within the community and
encourage others to not fear for the future and live a more present life. Moreover, destigmatizing
death might propagate open discussions of realistic living, encouraging a lifestyle that promotes
emotional well-being rather than destructive knowledge-seeking.

Socioemotional Selectivity Theory posits that as we age, our social goals move from a
knowledge-seeking approach to one that emphasizes emotional goals. As a byproduct, older
adults often focus on more positive experiences and emotionally meaningful pursuits, which may
correlate with the overall trend that adults after their 50s have significantly higher life
satisfaction ratings than younger adults. By destigmatizing the idea that life will end and
increasing accurate older representation within our communities, we can bridge the gap in life
satisfaction between younger and older adults, leading to healthier generations to come.
