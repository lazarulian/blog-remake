## **Slowing Down Forgetting**

- Testing one's memory has been shown to enhance long-term retention more effectively than just re-studying the material.
- **Spacing Effect**:
  - **Massed Practice**: This refers to repeatedly studying a list during a single session until it is learned.
  - **Distributed Practice**: Distributing or spacing out learning over periods of time proves superior for long-term retention.
    - Specifically, the "spacing effect" is observed when there's less forgetting after distributed practice compared to mass practice.

### Ebbinghausâ€™s Legacy

- Discovered the forgetting curve
- Savings effects after long delays (basically when you relearn spanish later in life)
- Spacing effect suggests that distributed learning works better than packed/massed learning

## Types of Memory

- Primary memory: memory stored in conciousness and is currently not stored in long term storage
- Secondary memory: memory that is being retrieved from your memory store

### Multi-Store Modal Model

- Information initially reaches our **sensory memory** through our sense organs, briefly capturing impressions from sensory stimuli.
- If we actively focus on or attend to these impressions, they transition to the **short-term memory (STM)**.
- To move information from STM to **long-term memory (LTM)**, it must be deeply understood or given significance, a process known as **elaborative rehearsal**.

|          | Sensory Register | Short Term Store | Long Term Store |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Duration | limited          | limited          | unlimited       |
| Capacity | very short       | short            | permenant       |

- What is interesting is when you retrieve from the long-term memory incorrectly, that can alter the memory as a whole, and you might code the inaccurate memory as a whole

### Modern Taxonomy of Memory

1. **Short-Term Memory (STM)**

- Refers to the temporary storage of information.
- Has limited capacity and is vulnerable to interference.
- Typically holds information for seconds to minutes.

2. **Long-Term Memory (LTM)**

- Refers to the permanent storage of information.
- Has vast capacity and can store memories for a lifetime.
  **a. Declarative Memory (Explicit)**
  - Deals with conscious recollections of facts and events.
    **i. Episodic Memory**
    - Personal memories of specific events, situations, or experiences.
    - Example: Remembering your first day at school.
      **ii. Semantic Memory**
    - General knowledge about the world, including facts, ideas, concepts, and language.
    - Example: Knowing the capital of a country or understanding the concept of gravity.
      **b. Non-Declarative Memory (Implicit)**
  - Unconscious memories that influence behavior and are not readily available for verbal description.
    **i. Skill Learning (Procedural Memory)**
    - Memory for performing actions or skills.
    - Example: Riding a bicycle, playing an instrument, or typing on a keyboard.
      **ii. Priming**
    - A change in response to a stimulus due to prior exposure to a related stimulus.
    - Example: Seeing an image of a red apple might make you quicker to recognize the word "fruit" in a subsequent task.
      **iii. Conditioning**
    - Learning through association, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a meaningful stimulus.
    - Example: Pavlov's dogs salivating when hearing a bell because it was associated with food.

## Stages of Memory

- The main stages of memory is encoding, storing, and retrieving
  - Encoding transforms information into a form that can be stored in memory
  - Storing maintains the encoded information within memory
  - Retrieving reaccesses information fro the past which has been encoded and stored
- When you pull information out with retrieval, your memory is variable and you can update it with new information

## **Testing Memory**

### **Avoiding Bias**

- **Random Assignment:** Subjects can be placed in any given condition.
- **Double-Blind Procedure:** Neither the experimenter nor the subject is aware of the condition the subject is in.

### **Explicit Memory Tests**

- **Free Recall:** Subjects must recall information without any cues. For example: "Please write down everything you can remember."
- **Cued Recall:** The memory target is paired with other information, where the paired info acts as a cue to retrieve the target memory.
- **Cued Serial Recall:** Subjects are provided one item from a list and must report the subsequent item.

### **Recognition**

- **General Concept:** During the memory test, subjects are presented with both previously seen (old) items from the study phase and new, unstudied items. This is often referred to as the "old/new" memory test.
  - **Recollection:**
    - Retrieves specific details and core facts of a memory.
    - Gives qualitative info like "where" and "when" an event happened.
  - **Familiarity:**
    - Acts as a signal strength that supports memory judgments.
    - Provides a sense of recognition without added context.
- **Force-Choice Recognition:** Subjects must determine which item they previously studied from two or more options.
- **Source Memory:** Refers to recalling the context of a memory, such as time and place.
- **Prospective Memory:** Remembering to execute a planned action or recall a planned intention at some future point.

### **Implicit Memory Tests**

- **Indirect Test - Word Fragment Completion:** Subjects complete word fragments, and their ability to do so can indicate prior exposure to the word.
- **Indirect Test - Eye Movements:** Monitoring a subject's eye movements can provide clues about their unconscious memory recall.
