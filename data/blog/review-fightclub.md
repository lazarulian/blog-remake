Proceed at your own risk, I am writing this as a way to share my thoughts after finishing Fight Club.

## Review - MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD

When I began reading Fight Club, the narrator presented us with an absurd world along with an incoherent jumble of thoughts. It was hard to understand what the narrator was talking about, and felt as if the narrator themselves was having a hard time grappling with reality. Then suddenly, the perspective shifted. The reader was transported from this hard-to-follow narrative to the mundane, cynical life the narrator was experiencing.

We begin to be introduced to Tyler and Marla, familiar characters from the opening but completely unknown to us with any sort of actual detail. As the novel progresses, we are exposed to more and more absurdity, all revolving around the figure Tyler, the narrator's roommate, and bizarre friend. We see the rise of the Fight Club, an outlet that allows the narrator to overcome his insomnia, and soon the terrorist cult that Tyler operates on a large scale. All of the changes within the narrator’s life seem to be materializing around him out of nowhere. As a reader, you share this connection to the narrator which in this case is a lack of control. The reader is in the dark, just like the narrator and has to understand the storyline through the faulty narration and the character Tyler.

As I began progressing through the novel, I began to wonder why the narrator would put up with the behavior that Tyler was exhibiting. My ideas ranged from Tyler’s charisma to the narrator needing a way to escape the insomnia-filled lifestyle he could return to. As the story continued to escalate in severity of Tyler’s actions, the narrator became less and less reliable in telling an accurate story, and when we realized that the narrator was suffering from multiple personality disorder and was in fact Tyler, everything made so much sense. The faulty narration, the absurdity, and why the opening was such a different energy then the rest of the beginning of the book. The narrator himself started to understand his situation and became more unstable as the book continued.

I think this novel was a great read because it really puts us into the shoes of someone with a split personality. From the gaps in memory to the general unstableness radiating from the narrator, we can begin to sympathize with what one must go through when in that predicament. The author also does this in a way that would not make the personality disorder obvious until the end of the book. The greater themes of the book that sort of seem to drive the narrator to madness are the dehumanizing effects of consumerism and capitalistic society. Overall, I think this book is a great read that really stands out from other novels.
