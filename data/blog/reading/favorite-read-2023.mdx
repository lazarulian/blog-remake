# Circle - Madeline Miller

There's just something about this book that resonated with me very strongly. From the moment I started reading Circe, I was captivated by the gorgeous language, the intricate details, and the captivating storytelling that just weaved together a beautiful story that made me feel human.

Throughout my childhood, Greek mythology has shaped my reading choices quite a bit, starting with the Percy Jackson series all the way to books like Ariadne. Circe is different because it follows an unconventional storyline to most of the action-driven mythology stories.

The story follows the life of the goddess Circe, who is banished on the island of Aiaia. Although her life on the island is inevitably a sorrowful one, the way that Circe deals with these problems, of life is profoundly rewarding. Her struggles aren't the struggles of a Greek Goddess or one of an ancient being, but themes like jealousy, patriarchy, unfairness, and loneliness something that most of us can relate to.

The best, most rewarding part of the entire book is being able to witness her struggle and feel a sense of connection with her. I got to see her relationships come and go, and how she handles them with abstract characters that resemble familiar types of people in modern life. I felt like I was living through her, seeing so many different types of love, whether it was romantic, or motherly and how those affect her mind.

Circe also reminded me of the power of change, and how important it is to keep changing in life. Everyone is capable of change, and it is important to see the good in people and understand that flaws are not the end-all be all in people.

## Favorite Quotes

> I thought once that gods are the opposite of death, but I see now they are more dead than anything, for they are unchanging, and can hold nothing in their hands.

> But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me.

> That is one thing gods and mortals share. When we are young, we think ourselves the first to have each feeling in the world.

## Concluding Remarks

If you like mythology, are looking for a humbling read, or just have some free time I cannot recommend this book enough. I was traveling through Spain, Portugal, and Switzerland when starting this book and finished it before the trip ended. It was just that good!

Some other books that I read this year and enjoyed are: _Klara and the Sun_, _Fight Club_, _What We Owe the Future_, and _The Fault in Our Stars_ ðŸ˜‹
