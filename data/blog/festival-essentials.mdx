## Overview

If you're well prepared, Music Festivals can be one of the greatest ways to see a ton of your favorite artists all at once. Festivals such as Rolling Loud, Coachella, and Lollapalooza provide stacked lineups for good prices. The only issue that these festivals face is that it can be potentially be a bad experience if you aren't prepared for it.

Conditions like crowds falling, dehydration, and hunger can make being deep in the pits really annoying. I'm going to go over some things that you should bring to have a great time.

## What to Bring

- High Fidelity Ear Buds
  - You're going to want these to prevent stuff like tinitus
- Hydration Pack
  - Getting out of the crowds to get water is really difficult, especially if you want to find your friends after
- Advil
  - when your feet are killing you late at night, this will come in clutch
- Comfortable Shoes
- Small Snacks

## What Not to Bring

- Wallet (Put small cards you need in your phone case or something )
- Heavy Backpacks

## Things to Watch out For

- Phone Theft - I have had two friends who had their phones stolen out of their pockts and fanny packs
  - I think it's worth to bring pants with a zipper or a jacket that has pockets on the inside depending on the weather
