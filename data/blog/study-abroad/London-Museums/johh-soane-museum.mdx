Among the highlights are the Sarcophagus of Seti I, a stunning example of ancient Egyptian craftsmanship, and the iconic Tivoli Recess, a meticulously curated display of architectural elements from the Roman era.
- **Paintings**: The museum houses a remarkable collection of paintings, ranging from Italian Renaissance masterpieces to the works of renowned British artists like J.M.W. Turner and Sir Joshua Reynolds. One of the most famous exhibits is a series of paintings by William Hogarth, entitled "A Rake's Progress," which provides a satirical commentary on 18th-century London society.
- **Architectural drawings**: As an accomplished architect himself, Soane had a keen interest in architectural drawings, amassing over 30,000 sketches, plans, and models throughout his lifetime. The museum showcases a selection of these works, offering a unique insight into Soane's design process and the evolution of architectural styles over time.
