## Neighborhood

Our location is in the beautiful area of South Kensington, a stone's throw away from Exhibition Road, Kensington Palace, and the stunning Hyde Park. It's a historical landmark that holds a special place in the heart of Londoners as it was the site of the Great Exhibition in 1851, which was promoted by Prince Albert. The Great Exhibition showcased the wonders of British industrialization and technology, drawing visitors from all over the world to marvel at the ingenuity and innovation of the era. With such a rich history and breathtaking surroundings, South Kensington is a truly magical place to be.

## Museums in the Area

The museums were a crucial aspect of the project, with a goal to educate and create a more skilled and curious population. The British Museum, for example, started as a collection of mixed objects, many of which were later moved to the National History Museum located in this same area. Today, South Kensington boasts an impressive array of world-class museums, all within easy reach.

This culturally rich neighborhood remains a beacon of inspiration for those seeking to broaden their knowledge and understanding of the world. Visitors are encouraged to immerse themselves in the fascinating history and breathtaking surroundings that make South Kensington a truly magical place to be.

## The Stand of the Natural History Museum

The Natural History Museum is a unique and groundbreaking institution that defied conventional thinking when it was first established. During a time when the Christian view of creation was dominant, the museum's presentation of the natural world as it truly exists was seen as highly controversial.

The museum's Renaissance terracotta construction is a testament to the grandeur and beauty of the natural world. Its intricate decoration showcases the diversity of life on Earth and emphasizes the order that exists within it.

One of the most striking features of the museum is the terracotta images of animals, insects, snakes, monkeys, apes, and more. These images represent the diversity of life on Earth, and they are organized according to categories such as mammals at the top, followed by lower life forms, extinct animals, and living animals.

In the central display, powerful images of animals surround an image of Adam, who is placed at the center to signify the pinnacle of God's creation. This arrangement serves as a reminder that humans are considered to be the highest form of life according to the Bible. These representations not only showcase the vastness and complexity of nature, but also reinforce the notion that there is a natural order to the world.

During the 19th century, there was a significant controversy as the literal truth of the Bible was challenged by new scientific discoveries, with Charles Darwin's work playing a pivotal role in this debate. The British Natural History Museum captures this moment in history and highlights the ongoing conversation about the relationship between science and religion.

## Idea vs. Authenticity

In museums, authenticity means displaying original objects that are directly connected to history. However, replicas or similar objects that convey the same idea can also be used to represent cultural and historical significance. Thus, the authenticity of an object is not always the only consideration when choosing objects for display. Non-authentic objects can also play a crucial role in conveying the historical and cultural context of an exhibit.

In summary the non authentic objects often have the power of providing insightful experiences that you might not even get from the authentic objects.
