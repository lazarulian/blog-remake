After a summer of working at Bluebeam, a software company based in the Architecture, Engineering, & Construction (AEC) industry, I have a lot of thoughts to share in terms of what I have learned from the internship, and as a whole from working in software.

### Initial Thoughts

When I first thought about the type of work that I was going to be doing at Bluebeam, I was under the assumption that a vast majority of software development has to do with web development and applicational engineering. I did not really consider many of the roles that software engineers were placed in to at high functioning companies.

When I was placed in the department of Research and Development I was thoroughly surprised and intrigued on what type of work I would likely be doing this summer. Looking back, being on the R&D team was one of the best experiences that I could have asked for because of the freedom that I was given within my project and because the frameworks that I was able to use within the project were so new.

I hope the following information gives a good idea on what to expect with Bluebeam and general Software Engineering Internships as well.

### Bluebeam Specific Information

##### Welcome Week

On our first few days of work, we went through a welcome week experience, where each day, we would go through relevant training, bonding experiences, and general presentations that would prepare us for our work this summer.

Being a part of an intern class of six, it was such a great intimate experience that really made me feel as if the organization was not only invested in me specifically, but preparing me for the workforce as a whole. Highlights include 1:1 introductions with our managers, understanding each others work styles through DISC assessments, and of course all of the free swag and food :)

##### Lunch & Learns

Throughout the duration of my tenure at Bluebeam, our wonderful recruiting team hosted many lunch and learns. In these lunch and learns, we were given presentations by employees and leadership within Bluebeam with topics ranging from career development to general life lessons. Meeting with people like the CEO, John Elliot, and other members of the Bluebeam community was some of the most eye opening experiences for someone that is just entering the workforce. Free lunch was also provided in office and through Uber Eats if we were remote for the day.

For all future interns out there, I really recommend branching out and asking as many questions as you can to people with a lot of experience, as their lessons that they have accrued through years of working can be very valuable early on in your career.

##### Intern Bonding Events

Outside of work, our recruitment team organized intern bonding events as well. Whether it was doing an escape room with our group or going for all-you-can-eat/drink bowling at a historic Bowling Alley in Los Angeles, all of these experiences were so fun, and I was so grateful for having them.

##### Volunteer Time Off

At Bluebeam volunteering was a very large part of the company culture with both interns and full-time employees receiving Volunteer Time Off days to encourage community service. I was lucky to have been a part of a great volunteering experience with Habitat for Humanity where we were able to help build a house in Pasadena. Volunteering with all of the full-time and part-time employees was great as it gave us a chance to talk about non-work related things and bond together over a great cause.

### General Software Engineering Thoughts

##### Research and Development

Working in R&D was one of the most thrilling positions I have held to this date. At work, I didn’t have to manage one Jira ticket after another or do any repetitive mundane tasks. I was fortunate enough to be given a problem that I could address in any way fit.

In this case, I used NLP, Deep Learning, and ML to approach one of Bluebeam’s needs within the software. It was exciting to work on something using frameworks that have come out weeks prior. General responsibilities included reading Research papers on new technology that could accelerate our software’s effectiveness, and developing novel proof of concept projects that would be implemented by more applicational engineers.

##### Takeaways

- Always say yes, having the ability to work on as many things as possible opens up doors and exposure that serves very useful in future endeavors.
- Reach out when you need help. College and the workforce are two different things and employers do not expect you to have the skillset to work in industry right away. Do not get stuck and stop there, grow and move forward from difficulty by asking for help.
- Network with others. Gaining exposure to other people’s journey in their career might open up ideas and career paths that you did not even know existed. It is always useful to get different perspectives and explore as much as you can during these years.

### Concluding Remarks

Overall I could not be any happier with my internship this summer at Bluebeam. The organization, company culture, and general care Bluebeam places on its employees made this experience unforgettable.

I would like to thank my manager Jaemin for being so helpful and dependable while I was working on my project. I would also like to thank my recruiter Kristin for giving me this opportunity and putting together this program in the first place. Apply to Bluebeam, you will not regret it!
