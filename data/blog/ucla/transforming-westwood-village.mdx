## Introduction

Okay before we go into all the things that we can do to make Westwood more vibrant for the students, businesses, and the community, it is important to lay out some general information on what the needs are, and then what is realistic for those needs. I can name so many things that I personally want that probably will not fly with the neighborhood council, or just wouldn't make any logistical sense.

## Current Needs that are Missing

**Energy**: what I mean by this is a vibrant environment that draws people to not only utilize the businesses around them, but keeps them there and establishes the location a place to spend free time at.

- Examples in Los Angeles: Westfield Century City & the Santa Monica 3rd Street Promenade.
- Examples at other Universities: Georgetown's Neighborhood and Telegraph & Durant at Berkeley.

**Transit**: When you want to go to DTLA, or really anywhere else in the city, the transit options are kind of limited. For downtown, your options are to go somewhere on sunset or to walk all the way down to Wilshire for the express bus. The other bus pickup spots range from the Luskin Loop to in the village. A major overhaul is needed for the transit infrastructure.

- Examples at other Universities: Berkeley's BART stop in downtown Berkeley, 116th Streetâ€“Columbia University station, UDub's U-District Station in conjunction with their light rails.

**Businesses**: There needs to be a better variety of busineses that not only cater to the needs of necessities (food & grocery), but also activities that students would want to partake in.

## Energy

### Close off Broxton to Cars

Considering that Westwood Village already has a European theme with the way the buildings are designed, I think it would be really cool to close down Broxton Avenue to create a space for people to hang out and for restaurants to offer outdoor dining. This street could be transformed into a pedestrian-only zone, lined with greenery, comfortable seating, and decorative lighting to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. This would not only improve the aesthetics but also create a greater sense of community within Westwood. Students, residents, and visitors could use the space to gather, relax, and enjoy the outdoors.

Incorporating outdoor dining would make the entire area more vibrant and attract more students to the restaurants because it would feel more social. The sight of people eating, chatting, and studying outside would create a lively and appealing atmosphere. Restaurants could expand their seating capacity, offering diners a unique alfresco experience that would set Westwood apart from other neighborhoods. People could physically see others around, and the improved atmosphere might encourage students and residents to frequent the businesses more often, contributing to the local economy. They already have this at places like Prince of Venice but it is kind of tucked away into the building. Imagine what all of these restaurants could do when the street is closed and there are string lights hanging above it.

Another benefit of this change would be the ability to make temporary features more permanent. For example, we could create a green space, similar to the Promenade, with outdoor seating, trees, and small gardens that would enhance the beauty and appeal of the area. This green space could host local events, such as farmers' markets (already exists on Thursdays), street performances, and art fairs, which adds to the general vibrancy of Westwood Village.

## Transit

### Bring the Light Rail to Westwood!

I feel like installing the light rail service from Strathmore/Gayley down to Wilshire/Gayley would be a great idea. It would allow students to, one, go to the village a lot more often and, two, access a lot more transportation options, creating a decreased reliance on car use. The reason why I want it at Strathmore and Gayley is because it's a major intersection between the hill and the apartment side, where most of the students live. The walk from the hill to Westwood Village is almost 15 minutes, and it's very hilly, so being able to use the light rail would decrease the barrier to getting to the village and using the businesses there.

The reason why it makes sense for the rail to run down Gayley is because the proposed metro station for Westwood will be at Gayley/Wilshire, and that walk can genuinely take 30 minutes from the Hill/Apartment Side.

Moreover, this light rail service could have broader impacts on the housing market in Westwood. By improving access to the Metro station and decreasing travel times, students would have the option to live farther away from campus in more affordable neighborhoods, without the need for a car. This could help relieve some of the pressure on Westwood's housing market, which is currently very expensive due to its proximity to UCLA. Lowering the demand for housing in Westwood could lead to more reasonable rental prices, giving students greater flexibility in their living arrangements and potentially alleviating the housing crisis that has affected so many in the area.

## Businesses

### Keep the Liquor Flowing

When going out, students often have to go to areas like Santa Monica to find a variety of bars in the same area. Currently, within Westwood, all we have is Rocco's and Broxton's Brewery, which are both great but leave a lot to be desired. I think creating more bars in Westwood would incentivize students to stay within the village at night, making it a safer place and reducing the odds of drunk driving or paying unnecessary expenses for Ubers. It would also make Westwood a lot more vibrant at night, as right now, around 9 or 10 PM, the city kind of dies a little bit.

Giving more liquor licenses to restaurants would also be great because events like bottomless brunches and other day drinking activities would allow businesses to thrive during the weekends when many students go home. Also when people are drunk, they will buy more food so businesses will thrive more.

### Creating UCLA Subsidized Activity Businesses

I think having certain businesses like bowling alleys, arcades, and other places where people can engage in activities would be beneficial to Westwood Village. These are the types of places that would draw people in beyond just shopping and spending money on food. This would also incentivize those living in the dorms to come down to the village rather than staying on the hill for most of the time.
