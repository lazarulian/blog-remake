## Overview

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={4} />

## Lisp

- **LISP**: LISt processor because the source code is comprised of lists.
- Lisp is the first **functional language**.
  - **ELisp** (Emacs Lisp) is a variant of Lisp used to write and extend the Emacs application.
  - Elisp is a language embedded as a part of larger applications (extension language)

An example of **app-specific language (ASL)**. To some extent, it's an example of the _little language philosophy_. The creators of Emacs took an existing language and mutated it to suit their particular problem.

## Namespace and Security

- Emacs is very traditional - a flat, top-level namespace that can be prone to clashing
- You have a lot of liberty in making problematic changes. This is allowed for example:

```lisp
emacs-version
; "28.2"
(setq emacs-version "100.0")
; "100.0"
(setq emacs-version "100.0")

; You can also mess around safely with scoped variables:
(let ((emacs-version "19.2"))
  (message "A %s" emacs-version)
  )
; "A 19.2"
```

- Trying to evaluate a variable that's never been assigned, you get a _runtime error_, very reliably
- There is _well-defined behavior_, as opposed to _undefined behavior_ like in C/C++, the former which is obviously _safer_
- The Emacs debugger also provides a traceback, but it reads bottom to top
  - To exit from the debugger, enter `C-]`

> Scripting languages thus tend to be used for exploratory programs, student codes, one-off programs, etc.

```lisp
(message "You can %s like printf!" "interpolate")
; "You can interpolate like printf!"
```

## The Language

### Fundamental Data Types

---

- `34` **integers**
- `34.4` **floats**
- `'eggert` **symbol** has a name, in this case `eggert` and has no other properties
  - a symbol can only has one name, which guarantees uniqueness via the symbol table
- `"eggert"` **strings** - do not care about line boundaries
  - strings with equal content are not unique

### Fundamental Data Structures

---

Emacs uses the same notation for programs and data. In other words, we use **data notation** to write our programs. The fundamental data structure in Lisp is the **list**, which is built from **cons**, which is just a pair of values. A list is singly-linked list of cons.

- `(cons a b)` builds a pair and gives you the result (allocates storage on the heap)
  - `[A|B]` is what it looks like (implementation)

**Lists**

- `(A B C D E)` five-item list, which are built out of pairs
  - `[A| ]->[B| ]->[C| ]->[D| ]->[E|/]` how the list implementation looks like
- `(A . B)` is a list without the nill character at the end of it, (does not chain)
- `(A B C . D)` = `[A| ]->[B| ]->[C|D]`
- `()` list of no elements (empty list)
- `nil` also the empty list
- `("A ()")` list of 1 element: the string "A"
- `(A ())` list of 2 elements: A and empty list
- `((A B C))` list of 1 element: a list with three elements

**Specifying Data Types**

- We use an apostrophe to treat something as data `'(f e g)` tells lisp to treat that as a list
- `(f e g)` would be a function call
- this is useful because lists can reprogram themselves

```elisp
(let ((a '(f e g)) # let a be list(feg)
     (b 29))       # let b be 29
(cons a b))        # execute function const on a and b
```

- `(A (B C) D)` = `[A | ]->[[B | ]->[C |\]| ]->[D|\]` (nested list)
- `(let ((foo (cons 29 '(37 -6)))))` = `[29 | ]->[37 | ]->[6| ]`
  - `(cons (cdr foo)(car foo))` = `[[37 | -> [-6 | ]] | 29]`

**Cons Nested List Example**

`(cons Hello (Brave New) World)`

### Variables

---

- `(defvar x 5)` `(defvar y 5)` define and set a variable

- `(setq x 5)` `(setq y 5)` Set the value of an existing variable

```lisp
(let ((a 1) (b 2)) ; local binding within the body
    (+ a b)
)
```

### Common Functions

---

- `quote` returns object, without evaluating it

  ```lisp
  (quote (+ 2 2))
  '(+ 2 2)
  ```

- `car` returns the first element in a list

  ```lisp
  (car '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
  ; rose
  ```

- `cdr` returns the rest of the list

  ```lisp
  (cdr '(rose violet daisy buttercup))
  ; (violet daisy buttercup)
  ```

- `cons` constructs lists

  ```lisp
  (cons 'I '(like lisp))
  ; (I like lisp)
  (cons (car '(rose violet daisy buttercup)) (cdr '(rose violet daisy buttercup)))
  ; (rose violet daisy buttercup)
  ```

- `append` attaches one list to another

  ```lisp
  (append '(1 2 3 4) '(5 6 7 8))
  ; (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)
  (cons '(1 2 3 4) '(5 6 7 8))
  ; ((1 2 3 4) 5 6 7 8)
  ```

- `(forward-char x)` moves x characters forward at cursor position
- `(other-buffer)`
- `(current-buffer)`
- `(point-min)` function with 0 arguments
- `(point-max)`
- `(count-lines beginning end)`

### Control Flow

---

- `(= 1 2)` comparison operator (bool return)
- `(> 2 2)` comparison operator (bool return)
- `(if (= 1 2))` "Yes" runs if true, "No" runs if false

### Special Forms

---

- `(if 0 (cons 3 5)(cons 4 7))` if `0` is nill evaluate `(cons 3 5)` else evaluate`(cons 4 7)`
  - useful as it is cheaper than a function call
- `(let((arg1 arg2) (arg3 arg4)) command)` goes through each pair until non-nil, and returns the corresponding item to the command
- `(and arg1 arg2)` evaluates from left to right, if one of the values evaluates to nil, it will return nil. Otherwise returns last item
- `(or arg1 arg2)` finds the first non-nil argument and returns that value

### Functions

---

```lisp
(defun function-name (arguments...)
    "optional-documetation..."
    (interactive argument-passing-info) ; optional
    ; body
)
```

Example:

```lisp
(defun multiply-by-thirty-five (number)
    "Multiply NUMBER by Thirty Five."
    (* 35 number)
)

; calling the function
(multiply-by-thirty-five 2) ; 70
```

- ; you can define a function to be interactive
- ; such functions can be called via M-x
- `(defun add (x y) (interactive) (+ x y))`

## Emacs Byte-code

- You can load external source code into the current namespace with:
  - `M-x load-file RET filename RET`
- As a solution to slow interpreting speed (due to the extensive use of pointers and dereferencing), ELisp uses **byte-codes** to compile data structures to create compact representations of a program.
- Byte-code differs from machine code:
  - **PRO:** byte-code is _portable_ and works on any architecture as it is designed for some abstract machine that the Emacs application knows about.
  - **CON:** Not as performant as machine code.

> Emacs Lisp has a compiler that translates functions written in Lisp into a special representation called byte-code that can be executed more efficiently. The compiler replaces Lisp function definitions with byte-code. When a byte-code function is called, its definition is evaluated by the byte-code interpreter.

- The numbers are analogous to opcodes in true machine code
  - Each number represents a certain elementary operation, like pushing data onto stack memory, adding two values, etc

For example, abstractly, this may be the compiled byte-code for some function:

```assembly
  1 push a (arg #1)
 10 dup
 27 *
  2 push b (arg #2)
 10 dup
 27 *
 26 +
105 sqrt
```

- Strung together they are functionally equivalent to the original Emacs function from which it was compiled, but now it can be compactly represented with a byte stream `1 10 27 2 10 27 26 105`.
- This in turn is more performant than uncompiled Emacs code because it can be run directly by a byte-code interpreter, in contrast to high-level language that needs to be parsed (tokenized and semantically analyzed) before executing - going off of some scattered knowledge here, anyone feel free to correct me.
- The byte-code files end with the `.elc` extension. You can compile a `.el` _source_ file with:

```emacs
M-x byte-compile-file RET filename.elc RET
```

`.elc` files can be loaded in the same way as `.el` files with `load-file`.

> Generally, you'd want to keep both the .el (so you can make future changes) and the .elc (so you get a performance gain) files on hand. But we're also talking about scripting in this class, and with the sizes of our scripts, this compiled/uncompiled speed difference is not noticeable (so bothering to make a .elc file in the first place is.. questionable. But it's good to know its purpose and that it's how Lisp works under the hood). **- Nik Brandt (Piazza)**

## The Emacs Interpreter

- Is a _single-threaded interpreter_
- There is only one instruction pointer (e.g. `%rip` on x86-64) at all times
- There's also a byte-code interpreter, which has some byte-code instruction pointer
- Emacs is itself a C program, so under the hood it's something like:

```c
// points to current instruction in byte-code sequence
unsigned char *bcip;
```

## Customizing Key Binds

```lisp
(global-set-key "@" "abcxyz")
; Now typing "@" is automatically replaced with "abcxyz"

; This is like setting keyboad macros:
(global-set-key "@", 'what-cursor-position)
; Now typing "@" automatically shows cursor position in minibuffer
```

- This could be a security hazard, because you can also include control characters. Emacs does provide an easy way to write control characters as strings:

```lisp
"\C-k" ; C-j
"^K"
```

- Emacs however checks if you attempt to recurse like:

```lisp
(global-set-key "!" "!")
; After 0 kbd macro iterations: Lisp nesting exceeds ‘max-lisp\
; -eval-depth’
```

## Elisp within Emacs

- You can use `M-: RET` to enter an `Eval` minibuffer.
- You can also eval a line in a main buffer by moving the cursor to the end of the Lisp list and then entering `C-x C-e.`.
- You can directly enter an initial buffer without a file called the \*scratch\* buffer. You do this by pressing `q` right after starting up Emacs.

**Lisp interaction mode:**

- Move cursor to end of Lisp expression line.
- `C-j` to evaluate this line.
- Output will be shown and written to the buffer.
- Use instead of `C-x C-e` if you want the history to be saved in the buffer itself.

## Exercises

```lisp
quote (1 2 3))                      ; (1 2 3)
'(1 2 3)                            ; (1 2 3)
(list (+ 1 2) '(+ 1 2))             ; (3 (+ 1 2))
(cons (+ 1 2) '(3 4))               ; (3 3 4)
(+ 10 (car '(1 2 3)))               ; 11
(append '(1 2) '(3 4))              ; (1 2 3 4)
(reverse (append '(1 2) '(3 4)))    ; (4 3 2 1)
(cdddar (1 2 3 4 5 6 7))            ; ERROR (unless cdddar defined)
```

## Customizing Emacs

Some Emacs jargon:

| Term   | Meaning                         |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Point  | Current position of the cursor  |
| Mark   | Another position in the buffer  |
| Region | Text between the mark and point |

The function `point` returns the current position of the cursor as a number.

`save-excursion` is often used to keep point in the location expected by the user:

```lisp
(save-excursion
    (actions-that-modify-point))
```

**TIP:** You can use `(global-set-key KEY COMMAND)` to define a custom key bind.

### Example Customization

**Explain how to arrange for Emacs to treat C-t as a command that causes Emacs to issue a message like this in the echo area:**

1. Define a function.
2. Use `current-time-string` to get current time, and use `concat` to concetatne time with other text
3. Make the function `interactive`
4. Use `message` for output in the echo area

   ```lisp
   (defun print-time ()
       (interactive)
       (message (concat "It is now" (current-time-string) ".")))
   ```

5. Create the `C-t` key binding:

   ```
   M-x global-set-key C-t print-time RET
   ```

## ASIDE: Concept of Pure Functions

Also known as **deterministic**, functions that have two properties:

1. Given a specific input `x`, the function _always_ returns the same output `y`.
2. It doesn't modify any data beyond initializing local variables required to compute its output.

```c
// Pure
int f(int p) {
    int q = 5 * p * p;
    return q;
}

// Impure
int z;
int f(int p) {
    return p * z++;
}
```

Notice that as long as you're using or modifying a global mutable variable, your function risks not being a pure function.

Functional languages...

- Are only composed of functions
- Can't change variable state (no `p = p + 1`).
- No loops, only recursion (because the counter `i` changes its state).
- Order of execution is not important because all functions are pure, so they won't have any _side effects_ by definition.
