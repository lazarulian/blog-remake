## Methods to Debug

- There are two main types of debugging
  - performance - Change code to optimize for hardware/better performance
  - the correctness - Verifying that the expected output matches the actual output

## Operational Tools

- Print statements (tracking variable states)
- `time` is a shell command that tells the amount of CPU time it takes to run a program
  - works on the unmodified program
- `ps` (process status) shows which processes take up the most time
- `ps -ef` print out all of the processes and their run time
- `ps -ejtf` print out all of the processes and their run time within a tree structure
- `top` list up the top 20 processes and how much time it has been taking
- `strace` a meta command that logs to standard error every system call that your program makes
  - these involve instructions to the kernel, instructions to hardware, c-library, graphics-library, etc.

## System Calls

- A way for programs to interact with the operating system (api to the kernel)
- The concept of an **operating system** was invented to facilitate interaction between programs and the hardware.
  - Without it, it would be much easier for programs to maliciously attack hardware or cause I/O conflicts with read/write operations.
- Programs can make **system calls** _to_ the operating system, and the operating system will then interact with the hardware in a well-defined way and report back with any output

### Categories of System Calls

1. Process control `fork`
2. File management `open`/`close` a file, `read`/`write`
3. Device management
4. information maintenance
5. Communication
6. Protection

### Valgrind

- valgrind is a debugging tool mainly used to detect memory-related bugs and to log all instructions a program executes.
- `valigrind ./a.out foo`
- valgrind isn’t perfect, but it does help against many trivial memory-related bugs such as bad references

```C
// valgrind will catch
char *p = NULL;
*p = 'x';
// but won’t catch
char a [10000];
char *p = &a[10000];
*p = 'x';
```

## GCC

### Stack Protection & Security

- `gcc -fstack-protection` allows you to call stack overflow bugs
  - This has to do with how the instruction pointer changes to a bogus part of program using buffer overflow attacks
  - the return instruction is the error
  - the fstack inserts extra code at the start of the program such that the location of the return address is not necessarily guaranteed and there is a stack canary
    - if the canary is dead, that means the buffer overflow attack has occured and the stack will be killed
    - This works because the attacker would have to overwrite the `randomvalue` to get to the bottom of the call frame to reach the return address, which is typically what they need to overwrite to continue their attack.
  - There is debate whether `-fstack-protector` is a default option. Some Linux distros like Debian and Ubuntu have it on by default. This is off by default on SEASnet. There's also the opposite option called `-fno-stack-protector` that turns the setting off.

## Performance Bugs & Optimization Flags

- The `-O`, `-O2`, `-O3`, etc. flags to specify the level of \*optimization **for CPU usage\***.
- `gcc -o` allows to slow down the compiler and then to improve the speed of the executable because of the optimizations it finds within the program
  - caches the registers
  - out of order execution
  - harder to debug because the code is a lot harder to read
- `gcc -o0` will allow for better debugging since the compile time is a lot faster
- `gcc -flto` performs link time optimizations that allow the o file to have a copy of the source code
  - way slower to compile and harder to debug
  - allows for source code level optimizations with the use case

### Performance Bug Improvements

- In GCC, there's a built-in function called `__builtin_unreachable()`
  - Your code should never call this function
  - The purpose of this is to mark a certain condition in your code as something that will never happen, so the compiler can optimize it away.

### Maximizing Cache Efficiency (Attributes)

- `__attribute__()` will be a message to the compiler which it can ignore
  - it is good that it can be ignored such that the compiler can ensure that the program does not break due to an incorrect suggestion
  - `#define __attribute__(x)`
- `char buf [1000] x __attribute__((aligned(8)));` this means that allocate x at a multiple of 8 bytes
  - this would improve the cache hit rate and would be good for the compiler to know
- `int f(int) __attribute__((cold));` tells the compiler that the function is rarely called
- `int g(int) __attribute__((hot));` tells the compiler that the function is called often
  - allows for the compiler to move the machine code into the cache so it does not have to miss and search in memory for the code

### Automating Hot/Cold with Profiling

1. You compile the program with a special flag that inserts extra code to count the number of times each instruction is executed. This understandably slows down execution.
2. You then run the program to gather the statistics.
3. Then, you recompile the program _with_ the statistics. That way, the compiler knows which instructions are hot and cold and can decided how to mark them itself.

- As long as your test runs are representative of how your program will actually be run, this is a great way of improving the performance of your application.
  - this is also a great way to ensure that either your test-cases or program does not have any dead regions that hurt the performance of the program

**Other GCC options**

```shell
gcc --coverage # adds extra instructions that update the profile (counter)
gprof
```

## Catching Bugs with Static Checking

Debugging your program _before_ the program runs. "Static" here has nothing to do with static allocation/static lifetime; it just means when the program isn't running. This is the opposite of **dynamic checking**.

- ➕ No runtime overhead.
- ➕ Covered bugs are 100% prevented by the time the program runs.
- ➖ Some bugs can not be statically checked for 100% reliably.

Example of static checking:

```c
static_assert(0 <= n);
```

The implication however is that the expression e.g. `0 <= n` MUST be computable at compile-time. If it isn't, it's a compiler error.

**EXAMPLE:** Suppose you have a program that assumes a `long` is 64 bits:

```c
#include <limits.h>
static_assert(LONG_MAX >> 31 >> 31 == 1);
```

This is once again like a _message from you to the compiler_. The compiler then checks beforehand for this condition before attempting to compile the program.

```c
if f (int n) {
  static_assert(n < 0);
    false
}
```

### GCC Warning Flags

In general, the flags beginning with `W` mean "warning". `-Wall` means "turn on all warnings":

```shell
gcc -Wall
```

However, people found that this tends to output extraneous/unnecessary warnings. Nowadays, `-Wall` has come to mean "turn on all warnings that most people will find useful."

## `-Wall` implies

- `-Wcomment`: warn about valid but bad comments like `/* a /* bad comment */`

---

- `-Wparentheses`: warn about style considered to be bad because something probably forgot parentheses in situations where operator precedence may be less familiar, like in `i << j + k` or `i < j || k < l && m < n`. The latter is common knowledge, but GCC disagrees, so this flag can be controversial.

---

- `-Waddress`: warn about making pointer comparisons when you probably didn't mean to, like `p = strchr("ab", "b"); if (p == "b") ...`

---

- `-Wstrict-aliasing`: warn about trying to "cheat" with pointers.

  ```c
  int i;
  long *p = (long *)&i;
  ```

  - Aliasing is when you have two names for the same object.
  - The C/C++ standard states that this results in undefined behavior, even if `int` and `long` happen to be the same size
  - This is controversial because a lot of low-level programs like the Linux kernel uses this all the time, _very carefully_
  - This is also why **casting** in general is risky because optimizing compilers may not do what you expect.

---

- `-Wmaybe-uninitialized`: warn about possible paths through a function where you use an uninitialized variable.

  ```c
  int f(int i)
  {
    int n;
    if (i < 0)
      n = -i;
    return n; // if i >= 0, uninitialized n is returned
  }
  ```

  If you do something that checks out with arithmetic reasoning, the compiler may or may not be find with it, depending on other flags you pass it.

  ```c
  int f(int i)
  {
    int n;
    if (i < 100)
      n = -1;
    if(i <= -1)
      return n;
  }
  ```

  Thus, there could be false positives if the compiler is not smart enough to deduce that the combination of things you've done always returns an initialized variable.

### Pure Functions

- With GCC, you can declare a [**pure function**](Elisp.md#aside-concept-of-pure-functions) with the signature, telling the compiler that this function should not modify the state of the machine:

```c
int hash(char *buf, size_t bufsize) __attribute__ ((pure));
```

- This is stronger than merely declaring the parameters as `const`. A pointer to `const` just promises to not modify an object via its pointer, not that its a pointer to an actual constant.

This way, if you do something like:

```c
char buf[100];
char c = buf[0];
i = hash(buf, sizeof buf);
// c == buf[0] must be true
// This gives the compiler opportunities to cache in register, etc.
```

This will be standardized in C23 as `[[reproducible]]`;

### Const Functions

- Not to be confused with the `const` qualifier on C++ methods.

```c
int square(int) __attribute__ ((const));
```

- This is an even stronger flavor of pure functions. The return value can not even depend on the current state of the function, only its arguments.
- A benefit is that if you call a `const` function multiple times with the same arguments, it could optimize knowing they would return the same value.
- This will be standardized in C23 as `[[unsequenced]]`.

### Defining a Memory Allocator

- give it how many bytes of memory to allocate and then it will return that
- `void * my_alloc(ptrdiff_t)__attribute((alloc_size(1), malloc(free, 1), returns_nonnull))` this is the way to declare the memory allocator

## Catching Bugs with Dynamic (Runtime) Checking

- An example of dynamic checking, where you check at _runtime_ and abort or similar if something fails:

```c
#include <assert.h>
int f() {
  /* code */
  assert(0 <= n);
}
```

- `if (n < INT_MAX) abort();` will prevent an integer attack
  - a better way to do this is define a sanitzer that does the runtime check for you

### GCC -fsanitize

Alternatively, you can let the compiler _insert_ runtime checking.

```shell
gcc -fsanitize=undefined
```

Generate extra code to make the program reliably crash if it attempts undefined behavior (except for addresses). This causes the program to be slightly slower.

At the machine level, the adding overflow may be implemented like:

```assembly
addl %eax,%ebx
jo   ouch       ; jump if overflow

ouch:
    call abort
```

- `gcc -fsanitize=addresss` check for bad uses of pointers
  - This is the same as `-fsanitize=undefined`, but for addressing errors, such as subscripting an array
  - Due to technical reasons, this actually only catches _most_ addressing errors, not all.
- `gcc -fsanitize=leak`
  - This attempts to insert runtime checks for **memory leaks**. Memory leaks are technically not undefined behavior nor errors.
- `gcc -fsanitize=thread`
  - This attempts to insert runtime checks for **race conditions**, where there may be multiple threads that attempt to access the same I/O resource.

Most of the time, these flags are useful for development only. They could be left in for production if the application prioritizes safety over performance.

## How to Debug a Program

### Common Advice

- do not guess at random where the bug is, use developer tools and guess non-randomly

1. Stabilize the Failure - find a testcase that reliably makes the program fail
2. Locate the Failure's Source - figure out why the crash occurred within the source of the failure
3. Put in print statements to find out more about the failure - GDB is a more efficient way of using print statements `(gcc -g)` is a good strategy to use. Basically it turns off the address randomization which causes issues with debugging.

## Review

- try not to debug, use static checks and compiler runtime flags to debug rather than going through the codebase and making random changes
- write test cases - test driven development allows to think on where your code might fail and allow for separation of information
  - maybe use C++, Java, or Rust
- become a defensive programmer using tools such as runtime checking, putting in your own checks, and using traces and logs
  - allows for retrospective analysis of failure
  - use assertions to do runtime checks
- Use a barricade design pattern that allows for a barricade that protects bad access to the internals to your system
- use interpreters (software support)
- virtual machines to test on different systems (hardware support)
