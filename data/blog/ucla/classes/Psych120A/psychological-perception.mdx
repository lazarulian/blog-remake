## Gestalt Principles & The Perception of Groups

- **Characterizing Meaning within Gestalt Principles**
  - **Figure Ground**: elements will be percieved as either figures or ground (the background where figures are)
  - **Simplicity** (Law of Pragnanz): we will percieve things in a way that makes it simpler for us to understand
  - **Proximity**, things that are close together are percieved as related than things that are spaced far apart
  - **Similarity**, things that are similar are likely to be related and grouped together
  - **Good** **continuation**, elemnts arranged on a continuous line or curve are percieved to be more related than elements not on the line or curve
  - **Closure**: incomplete objects will tend to be perceived as wholes

## Recognizing Visual Objects

1. Represent the Physical Stimulus in STM (Short Term Memory)
2. Find a representation in LTM (Long Term Memory) that matches the current one

### Template Theory

- **Template Theory:** We have mental templates in our mind for every object that we know and recognize.
  - We recognize something by comparing the correlation of similartiy to the template that is stored in the LTM
  - The issue with this theory is that there are never any perfect match and the database of templates is very large
- **Templates + Transformations:** Before matching the templates, there are transformations that take place to sort of normalize the data before matching
- **GEONS:** geometric elements of which all objects are matched to
  - We put geons together to make objects

### Recognition by Components Theory

- **Basic properties of GEONS**
  - They have to be easily discriminated
  - View invariant (looks identical from most viewpoints)
  - Robust to noise
- **Difficulties of Geons**:
  - Deriving structural representations and geons can be difficult
  - Contextual evidence is omitted, which is a vital part of understanding things

### Top Down Processing

- Perception is not automatic and there is a lot of extraneous factors that need to be considered to identify objects
- Top Down Processing occurs involving making inferences based on past experiences or surrounding experiences
  - This processing is also represented in the brain as follows
- **Word Superiority Effect:** people are better at recognizing whether a letter was present when they are given a word rather than a non-word
  - this is due to the presence of bigram detectors, which is when we detect pairs of letters together
