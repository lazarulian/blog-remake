## Maharaja

What's great about Maharaja is the lunch buffet. During the week, they have the buffet for $15.99 with all you can eat garlic naan, paneer, lentil, vegetable, salad, and dessert. On the weekend, the lunch special also comes with champagne including two refills!

When eating normally, I would recommend going family style. The appetizers are great and my personal favorite is the Vegetable Pakora. My favorite of the main dishes has to be the Roohni Paneer. Overall, as a college student, eating family style might be a little expensive and I would recommend coming in for a weekend brunch to get those Champagne refills.

**Overall 7/10 food quality, 9/10 value.**

## Tulsi

Coming from the Bay Area, I have been exposed to a lot of Indian restaurants but have never seen a Indian fast food place with this much selection. Offering food from North, South, and West India, Tulsi is a place that has everything for everyone. Did I mention that the place is fully vegetarian!!

THe food here is pretty good, would not say its restaurant level but good for the price for sure. I recommend getting the two combo which comes with: two curries, one daal, a naan, and some rice. Don't sleep on the Daal Makhni, it's so good.

**Overall 6/10 food quality, 9.5/10 value.**

## Bollywood Bites

The chef of Bollywood Bites claims to have been the personal chef of Michael Jackson. Whether that's true, I am not sure but the food here is good. Being in the heart of Westwood Village, the location is hard to beat.

The problem with this place is that it is so damn expensive! I would much rather prefer going to Maharaja over this place because the quality of food difference is marginally different compared to the price.

**Overall 8/10 food quality, 5/10 value.**
