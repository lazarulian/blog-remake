## The Challenge: Packing Right

Getting ready to leave for study abroad is an incredible feeling, but making sure you've got everything packed? A tad overwhelming. Having navigated this challenge myself, I'm here to share the lessons learned.

### Baggage Basics

- **Weight Limit:** Airlines have stringent baggage policies. In the U.S., many airlines cap the weight limit for checked bags at 50 pounds. It's crucial to be informed beforehand, lest you want to shell out extra for excess baggage.
- **Travel Adaptors:** Different countries have different plug and voltage configurations. The adaptors ensure your devices can be charged without any hitches. It's always a good idea to have a couple: one for your stay and another for on-the-go needs.

### Medication & Personal Care

- **Over-the-Counter Meds:** Medications readily available in the U.S. might be restricted in other countries. For example, a simple painkiller that you pick up without a prescription back home might be locked behind pharmacy counters abroad. So, pack essential meds!
- **Toiletries:** Bring all of the things that you use for skincare, shampoo, and body wash. Also pack small travel toiletries in a clear ziplock bag because that's what you'll have to do everywhere for carry on bags.
- **Hostel Lifesavers:** If hostels are on your itinerary, some essentials will drastically improve your experience. A **microfiber towel** dries quickly and takes up minimal space; **shower slippers** ensure you aren't treading on shared bathroom floors barefoot; and an **eye mask** guarantees sleep even if your roomie decides to read with the light on.
- **Locks:** Hostels are a great way to stay for cheap, but they're also prone to theft. I would get a combination lock, so there's no key to lose.

### The Art of Packing Light

- **Backpacks for Short Trips:** For those impromptu trips or weekend getaways, a spacious backpack is preferable over bulky luggage. It's not just more convenient, but also most budget airlines' cabin-friendly.
- **Smart Clothing Choices:** I brought four hoodies and barely wore more than 2. Prioritize versatile clothing suitable for multiple occasions.
- **Hairdryer:** Electrical voltage varies across countries, and your hairdryer might not be compatible, leading to potential damage or even safety hazards.

### Special Recommendations

- **Packing Cubes:** For those who love an organized suitcase, packing cubes, like the ones from Peak Design, are a blessing. They compartmentalize your belongings, making packing and unpacking a breeze.
- **Reserve Some Space:** Leaving some space in your luggage ensures you have room for souvenirs and other things you might buy abroad.

## The Ultimate Packing List

For those who love a good checklist, hereâ€™s a condensed packing list that you can refer to while getting ready:

- **Essentials:**

  - [ ] Passport & Visa
  - [ ] Travel insurance documents
  - [ ] ALL medications (Advil, Allergy, Melatonin, Vitamins, etc)
